JDoctest is an implementation of Python doctest for Java, based on the
ideas in doctestj (http://code.google.com/p/doctestj/) and Rhino
(http://blog.norrisboyd.com/2008/03/doctest-in-rhino.html).

Unlike doctestj, JDoctest is a Taglet, rather than a Doclet.  It doesn't
replace the standard javadoc, it just adds the @test tag.
We also use a multiline format similar to Python's doctest (based on Rhino's
implementation) rather than insist on a single evaluated expression, as
doctestj does.
